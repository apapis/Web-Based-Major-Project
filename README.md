# About the CS39930 web based major project repository

This is where you will keep all your work for the CS39930 web based major project.   When it is complete, you will export this repository and upload it to Blackboard before the project deadline.  The export will include a full commit history as well as various documents and items of technical work.

You can clone your repository and work on any computer - your own computer or any of the University workstations.  Remember to commit early and commit often, and to push your work back to GitLab.  If you do that, it is actually quite difficult to lose or spoil your work.

** If you are off campus, you need to use the University VPN to access https://gitlab.aber.ac.uk **

# About the Documents directory

The documents directory will contain the sources (Word files, LaTeX sources, markdown, ODT ...) of your documents.  Documents will include:
- Project Outline (no marks but will be used in chapter 1 of the Final Report)
- Business Analysis (10% of the marks for the web-based major project)
- UI design and evaluation (10%)
- Technical Design (10%)
- Final Report (30%)
- Ethical clearance emails and attachments (no marks but will be added as appendices to the Final Report)

You can find out more about all these in Blackboard.

** IMPORTANT: The Project Outline, Business Analysis, UI design and evaluation and the Final Report must be uploaded to Blackboard as PDFs before their respective deadlines.  Only work uploaded to Blackboard before a deadline can be marked. **

There is no need to keep the PDFs in GitLab (unless they were created using a PDF editor).  The PDFs will normally be generated from Word, or LaTeX or markdown or some other source, and it is the sources that you keep in the repo.

# About the Technical Work directory

The Technical Work directory will contain source code, configurations, installation instructions and so forth.  If you use external software - for example, if you install WordPress or a database management system - you should not include the external package(s) in your technical work.  Instead, you should only include any project-specific configurations that you use, and you should provide instructions to recreate your project.

It should be possible for the examiners to rebuild your project using your instructions and using the content of the Technical Work directory.

The technical work and the demonstration will count for 40% of the marks for the web based major project.

# About Journal.md (This text is copied from Journal.md)

Each week you should make a journal entry to record progress on your project and to receive feedback. Each weekly entry should summarize:

- tasks carried out during the week, with hours spent against each item;
- tasks planned for the following week
